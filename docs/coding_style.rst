You can find our complete flake8 configuration in the tox.ini_ file.


Data Sets
---------

For each data set, please provide a comment with reference to the source
and/or origin of the data.

We only accept new data if it's coming from statistical sources, such as census or government institutions. This include names and their distribution.


Name Lists
----------

When you have long lists of names, please order them alphabetically. Keep the lines length as close as possible to 120 characters, without exceeding the limit.
